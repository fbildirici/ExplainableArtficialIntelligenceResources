# Explainable AI (XAI): The Hitchiker's Guide of Explainable Artificial Intelligence

## Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has seen remarkable progress over the past decade, driving its adoption across domains such as healthcare, finance, law, and autonomous systems. However, the increasing complexity of modern AI models, particularly deep learning architectures, has introduced significant challenges in transparency, interpretability, and accountability. Explainable AI (XAI) has emerged as a crucial research domain aimed at developing methodologies and tools that make AI-driven decision-making processes comprehensible to humans.

The ability to interpret and explain AI models is essential for fostering trust, ensuring ethical deployment, and complying with regulatory requirements. This repository offers a meticulously curated collection of scholarly resources—featuring foundational books, influential academic papers, specialized online courses, and state-of-the-art tools—tailored for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers working in the field of XAI. **Updated as of February 25, 2025,** this guide reflects the latest developments and resources available.

# Explainable AI (XAI): A Scholarly Resource Guide

## Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has witnessed remarkable advancements over the past decade, leading to its widespread adoption across various domains, including healthcare, finance, law, and autonomous systems. However, the complexity of contemporary AI models, particularly deep learning architectures, has introduced significant challenges regarding transparency, interpretability, and accountability. Explainable AI (XAI) has emerged as a critical research field aimed at addressing these challenges by developing methodologies and tools that enhance human understanding of AI-driven decision-making processes.

The ability to interpret and explain AI models is essential for fostering trust, ensuring ethical deployment, and enabling regulatory compliance. This repository serves as a meticulously curated collection of scholarly resources, encompassing foundational books, influential academic papers, specialized courses, and state-of-the-art tools for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers interested in the field of XAI.
